This trivial package provides an easy interface to the tinyurl.com URL
shortener.

Put the following in your .emacs:

(push "~/src/tinyurl.el" load-path)
(autoload 'tinyurl "tinyurl" nil t)

If you then have a long URL in your kill ring, saying `M-x tinyurl'
will put a shortened version of that URL in your kill ring instead.
